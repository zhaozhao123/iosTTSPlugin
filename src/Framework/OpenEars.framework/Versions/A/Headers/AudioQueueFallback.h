//
//  AudioQueueFallback is a class which simulates speech recognition on the Simulator since the low-latency audio unit driver doesn't work on the Simulator. 
//  Please do not ever make a bug report about this driver; it is only here as a convenience for you so that you can test recognition logic in the Simulator,
//  but it is not the supported driver for OpenEars and using it gives you no information about the performance or behavior of the actual OpenEars audio driver.
