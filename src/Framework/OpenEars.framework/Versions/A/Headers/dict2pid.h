 * 
 * HISTORY
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2006/04/05  20:27:30  dhdfu
 * A Great Reorganzation of header files and executables
 * 
 * Revision 1.9  2006/02/22 21:05:16  arthchan2003
 * Merged from branch SPHINX3_5_2_RCI_IRII_BRANCH:
 *
 * 1, Added logic to handle bothe composite and non composite left
 * triphone.  Composite left triphone's logic (the original one) is
 * tested thoroughly. The non-composite triphone (or full triphone) is
 * found to have bugs.  The latter is fended off from the users in the
 * library level.
 *
 * 2, Fixed dox-doc.
 *
 * Revision 1.8.4.5  2005/11/17 06:13:49  arthchan2003
 * Use compressed right context in expansion in triphones.
 *
 * Revision 1.8.4.4  2005/10/17 04:48:45  arthchan2003
 * Free resource correctly in dict2pid.
 *
 * Revision 1.8.4.3  2005/10/07 19:03:38  arthchan2003
 * Added xwdssid_t structure.  Also added compression routines.
 *
 * Revision 1.8.4.2  2005/09/25 19:13:31  arthchan2003
 * Added optional full triphone expansion support when building context phone mapping.
 *
 * Revision 1.8.4.1  2005/07/17 05:20:30  arthchan2003
 * Fixed dox-doc.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2005/06/21 21:03:49  arthchan2003
 * 1, Introduced a reporting routine. 2, Fixed doyxgen documentation, 3, Added  keyword.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2005/06/13 04:02:57  archan
 * Fixed most doxygen-style documentation under libs3decoder.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/04/21 23:50:26  archan
 * Some more refactoring on the how reporting of structures inside kbcore_t is done, it is now 50% nice. Also added class-based LM test case into test-decode.sh.in.  At this moment, everything in search mode 5 is already done.  It is time to test the idea whether the search can really be used.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/03/30 01:22:46  archan
 * Fixed mistakes in last updates. Add
 *
 * 
 * 14-Sep-1999	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added dict2pid_comsseq2sen_active().
 * 
 * 04-May-1999	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Started.
