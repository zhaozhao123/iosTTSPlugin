/**Generate a language model from an array of NSStrings which are the words and phrases you want PocketsphinxController or PocketsphinxController+RapidEars to understand. Putting a phrase in as a string makes it somewhat more probable that the phrase will be recognized as a phrase when spoken. fileName is the way you want the output files to be named, for instance if you enter "MyDynamicLanguageModel" you will receive files output to your Documents directory titled MyDynamicLanguageModel.dic, MyDynamicLanguageModel.arpa, and MyDynamicLanguageModel.DMP. The error that this method returns contains the paths to the files that were created in a successful generation effort in its userInfo when NSError == noErr. The words and phrases in languageModelArray must be written with capital letters exclusively, for instance "word" must appear in the array as "WORD". */
